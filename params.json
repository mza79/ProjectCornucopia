We are not Crate Employees, so changes we make are perhaps not 100% of their vision, but we get a better glimpse of their intended product with every comment they make and every update they release.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of updates, Project Cornucopia has been consistently releasing updates of its own while incorporating changes made to the base game by Crate Entertainment...but only those which we believe are 'healthy for balance', or, rather, those which contribute to the aforemention first goal for the Project.\r\n\r\nProject Cornucopia has been featured in a couple mod merges as well, including - but not limited to - the Grimmer and Grimmest mod (http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?p=392078) and the DAIL mod (http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=38785).\r\n",
